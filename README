Compiled and tested with a recent Sun Microsystems JDK: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_16-b01) and JRE 6u17 under linux x64

All function and variable names should be self-explanatory

Usage:
Compile with e.g.
$ javac main.java
Make sure the 'train.dat' file resides in the same directory as the main.class
Also, the directory has to be writable for the 'epocheerror.dat'
Execute the program with e.g.
$ java main
Or alternatively, if it generates too much output
$ java main > /dev/null
