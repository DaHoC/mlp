# This file is not needed, all the settings can be made in the program
# and the weights can be initialized randomly in the main program
# This file contains the net topology (and all weights),
# it has to reside in the same directory as the main program
# First line: The net topology in the form N-H-M
# Second line: Bias weights to hidden layer
# Following N lines: weights from layer N to layer H, w_n_h with row=n, column=h
# Following (N+1)th line: Bias weights to output layer
# Following H lines: weights from layer H to layer M, w_h_m with row=h, column=m
#
# Here, I used the exercise 19 weights and topology to test the mlp:
# 4-2-1
# x0h1 x0h2
# x1h1 x1h2
# x2h1 x2h2
# x3h1 x3h2
# x4h1 x4h2
# h0y
# h1y
# h2y
