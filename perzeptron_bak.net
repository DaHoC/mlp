# This file contains the net topology (and all weights),
# it has to reside in the same directory as the main program
# First line: The net topology in the form N-H-M
# Second line: Bias weights to hidden layer
# Following N lines: weights from layer N to layer H, w_n_h with row=n, column=h
# Following (N+1)th line: Bias weights to output layer
# Following H lines: weights from layer H to layer M, w_h_m with row=h, column=m
